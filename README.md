# cs50
An attempt to fork the CS50 project locally. Import libcs50 to allow the use of the course's commands.

This is my attempt at completing this course with some added complexity. Apart from the projects themselves, I plan on looking over the library provided, and seeing how it works from a lower level perspective. 

I'd also like to extend the projects assigned and find some way to find practical use for them. I'll be writing short posts on each exercise from both a historical and technical perspective. I hope to gain insight on the use of these simple assignment in things outside the course.

To sum up, this will lay the groundwork for future courses/projects I embark on. I hope to learn Git/Github with this as well.
